# yaml_metadata

A YAML-based metadata template and Python scripts that build on it to support research data management.

## Description

This metadata file template supports a minimalistic approach to research data management, based on two key assumptions:

1. Research data will only be managed professionally — and on a voluntary basis — if the process is as simple and accessible as possible, and can be carried out with minimal time investment.

2. As a common denominator across different researchers and technical environments, research data is typically stored in a folder structure — for example, on a personal computer, a network drive, or in the cloud.

Under these conditions, metadata from different studies can be stored in a distributed and decentralized manner using the provided template.

A folder structure with subdirectories for each dataset — following a suggested naming convention — is recommended.

With the help of Python scripts, the metadata can be aggregated in various formats and made usable — for example, as Excel spreadsheets or JSON files for import into a document-based database (e.g., MongoDB).
