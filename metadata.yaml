# Experiment Metadata File
#
# This template provides a minimal documentation of an experiment data
# set. Each data set in our research repository (each subfolder associated 
# with one specific data set) should contain a metadata file providing 
# information about the originating study. If necessary, the template can be 
# extended with additional data fields.

# Researchers should provide the approximate date when the data collection was
# finished. There are different cues to this, e.g. the creation date of the
# raw data set, a timestamp for the last experimental session in the data, or
# the time of creation for the last video or audio recording. The chance to
# infer the end date of a data collection should be relatively high even with
# sparse information. This date should also be used at the beginning in the 
# name of the folder containing the metadata file to allow for matching.

date_of_study: 2022-04-05

# The researcher responsible for the data collection should named. If the 
# associated repository contains data sets from multiple researchers, a unique 
# identifier (e.g., the first character of the first name and then the first 
# six characters of the last name) should be assigned to each researcher. This 
# identifier should be used follwoing the date in the name of the folder 
# containing the metadata file to allow for later matching.

responsible_researcher: ctreffe (Christian TreffenstÃ¤dt)

# The study name should be a short but unique identifier. This variable should 
# provide a first reference when matching any data to the experiment. This
# identifier should be used following the identifier for the responsible 
# researcher in the name of the folder containing the metadata sheet to allow 
# for later matching.

study_name: Unique identifier, e.g. "JAS MA 3"

# If a study was referenced with multiple aliases, provide the primary alias
# as study name and all additional aliases under the following alias list.

aliases:
  - First alias
  - Second alias

# As a basic differentiation between types of studies, provide the type of 
# study as either 'online' or 'laboratory' (without quotes).

study_type: online

# To allow for a general classification of studies, provide the general
# research area for which the data was collected. In addition, provide common
# abbreviations for the research area where applicable. Examples are:
# Emergence of Leadership(EOL), Judge Advisor System (JAS), Escalation of
# Commitment (EOL), Sunk Cost Effect (SC), or Accountability (ACC).

research_area: Judge Advisor System (JAS)

# Each metadata sheet should contain a short description of the underlying
# study. The description should provide other researchers (those not
# responsible for the data collection) with a basic understanding of the
# study, the collected data, and the provided materials and files.

description: >
  Please provide a short content description of the study from which the 
  dataset originated. Readers should get a basic understanding of the raw 
  data based on this description.

# In addition to the description, a list of available resources for the study 
# should be provided in no particular order. All files in the associated folder 
# should be present on the available resources list. This will allow users to 
# apply filters when searching the research repository.

available_resources:
  - Materials (e.g. experiment code, instruction files)
  - Data (e.g. raw data, edited data sets)
  - Codebook
  - Analysis scripts
  - Additional files (e.g., videos, audio recordings, scanned surveys)

# If the data set has already been published, all relevant citations should be
# provided to allow linking folders in the research repository to specific
# publications and to provide additional filter options.

publication: >
  Please provide an unformatted full citation if the data set is part of 
  an publication. If the data set is part of multiple publications, 
  provide the citation for the primary publication and provide 
  additional citations in the notes section. You can, also cite 
  unpublished manuscripts.

# All available online resources (e.g. GitHub repositories for experimental
# code, OSF repositories containing preregistrations, additional online
# materials) should be provided in the metadata file to provide a full account of
# all available data and materials for each study.

online_resources:
  - Provide link to first resource (explanation in parentheses, one line only)
  - Provide link to first resource (explanation in parentheses, one line only)
  - Provide link to first resource (explanation in parentheses, one line only)

# A substantial number of computer experiments conducted by the Department of 
# Economic and Social Psychology is created using alfred (a library for rapid 
# experiment development), and the mortimer web interface. The following 
# section is included to provide additional information on alfred experiments,
# specifically the experiment ID ("exp_id" from the data set), the alfred 
# version ("alfred_version" from the data set for alfred3), and the URL of the 
# mortimer instance on which the experiment was hosted (e.g., 
# "alfredo3.psych.bio.uni-goettingen.de/mortimer3"). This information will 
# facilitate participant screening, and rerunning the experiment code with the 
# appropriate alfred version. If the documented experiment was not created 
# with alfred, leave the following variables unchanged.

alfred_exp_id: null

alfred_version: null

mortimer_url: null

# Provide additional miscellaneous information in the notes section, for 
# example additional citations. 

notes: >
  This section is reserved for miscellaneous information that the responsible 
  researcher deems relevant, but which does not belong anywhere else in the
  metadata sheet.
